# conv-net-pytorch
Implementation of a simple CNN in PyTorch

Implemented: *convolutional*, *pooling*, *reshaping* and *fully-connected* layers, *ReLU* activation. 
All these were implemented from scratch, in both scalar and vector form.

Comparison of pytorch and custom implementation are available
[here](https://github.com/OlehLuk/conv-net-pytorch/blob/master/Comparison%20with%20PyTorch%20implementations.ipynb).

There is *no significant difference* in implementation outputs.

Comparison of time consumption scalar and vector versions 
are available in the [notebook](https://github.com/OlehLuk/conv-net-pytorch/blob/master/One%20batch%20time%20consumption.ipynb)
